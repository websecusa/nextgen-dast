# Changelog

All notable changes to **nextgen-dast 2.1.1**.

This project ships from a single rolling `2.1.1` line — every entry
below is on that release. Items are grouped by the month they landed
in `master`; dates are the calendar date of the merging commit.

The format borrows from [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
adjusted for a rolling release where every change is folded into the
running 2.1.1 image at `dockerregistry.fairtprm.com/nextgen-dast:2.1.1`.

— Tim Rice <tim.j.rice@hackrange.com>


## 2025-04 — Bootstrap

- **2025-04-30** — Initial repository: orchestrator, FastAPI server,
  scanner runners (zap, nikto, testssl, nuclei, dalfox, ffuf-skeleton),
  MariaDB schema, and the pentest.sh controller.


## 2025-05 — Triage workflow lands

- **2025-05-02** — Tag the initial release as **2.1.1** and freeze
  the rolling line; image tag and git branch will not be bumped
  without explicit owner approval.
- **2025-05-04 / 05-05** — README cleanups (registry pull is public,
  drop noisy Support section).
- **2025-05-07** — **Challenge / False-Positive workflow** on the
  finding detail page. Per-finding "Challenge" button calls a matched
  toolkit probe and writes the verdict back to the finding row.
- **2025-05-09** — Authenticated Challenge: re-use the assessment's
  stored creds, run a dual-baseline (anonymous vs authenticated) probe
  so login-required findings are exercised correctly.
- **2025-05-11** — `htaccess_bypass` recognises the
  *200 + login form* anti-pattern as effectively-protected.
- **2025-05-12 / 05-14** — Exclude false-positive findings from the
  severity rollup and PDF report; surface them as a separate KPI tile
  on the assessment-detail page.
- **2025-05-16** — Final UK→US English sweep across UI, reports, and
  comments (catches the residual `-ise` / `-isation` forms).
- **2025-05-18** — **Bulk Challenge** button on the assessment page;
  high-confidence "not reproduced" verdicts auto-flip the finding to
  `status=false_positive`.
- **2025-05-20** — `testssl`: drop noisy "test does not apply on this
  host" WARN rows from the parsed findings.
- **2025-05-21** — PDF report: top-of-page placement, one report per
  assessment, `<fqdn>_<date>.pdf` naming.
- **2025-05-23** — Per-assessment **"hide info-severity findings"**
  toggle (persists; affects page AND PDF).
- **2025-05-25** — Orchestrator: fix `NameError` on the entrypoint
  path so queued assessments actually start.
- **2025-05-27** — `enhanced_testing/` scaffolding: reference probe
  + Juice Shop test fixture + 50-probe TODO roadmap.
- **2025-05-28** — Server reaps zombie assessments after a container
  restart so a crash mid-scan no longer leaves rows wedged in
  `running`.
- **2025-05-30** — **Premium profile**: 5 new probes, orchestrator
  wiring, UI exposure, schema migration.


## 2025-06 — Toolkit, ffuf, REST API

- **2025-06-01** — Orchestrator defaults `findings.evidence_url` to
  the scan target when a tool didn't emit one; breach-compression probe
  matches the bare "BREACH" finding title.
- **2025-06-03** — Re-add `premium` to the `/assess` profile validator
  after the previous tightening dropped it.
- **2025-06-05** — **Default-credential probes**: generic backbone +
  vendor-specific catalog (covers the most common admin / management
  endpoints).
- **2025-06-06** — Orchestrator: implement the `dalfox` case in
  `run_tool` so the scanner is actually scheduled (was previously a
  no-op).
- **2025-06-08** — Round-2 enhanced_testing probes: 5 new + parser
  wiring.
- **2025-06-10 / 06-12** — `htaccess_bypass`: manifest CLI-arg drift
  fix, US-English spelling cleanup.
- **2025-06-13 / 06-15** — **ffuf for content discovery** in the
  thorough + premium profiles, plus a vendored ffuf wordlist so an
  offline rebuild reproduces the same coverage.
- **2025-06-19** — `/assess` form: document `host:port` form in the
  FQDN field hint.
- **2025-06-20** — **REST API + `application_id` field + report
  polish.** Adds the `/api/scans` line of endpoints and gives every
  assessment a stable application identifier separate from the FQDN.
- **2025-06-22** — Vendor Swagger UI assets so `/docs` works with no
  outbound CDN dependency.
- **2025-06-24** — `/docs`: per-field help modal; `GET /scans` accepts
  an `fqdn` filter.
- **2025-06-26** — `GET /scans/{id}/results` accepts `include_info`
  filter.
- **2025-06-27** — Cleanup: deletion sweeps reports, challenge logs,
  and orphan files (the previous code only removed the DB rows).
- **2025-06-29** — **Modern dashboard shell** + `/` overview page.


## 2025-07 — Workspace UI + live risk score

- **2025-07-01** — **Three-column findings workspace** + tightened
  sidebar logo.
- **2025-07-03 / 07-04 / 07-06** — UI polish: oversized CTA icon fix,
  stale-CSS cache invalidation, select-all checkbox restored,
  Untitled UI stroke icons for Archive / Export.
- **2025-07-08** — `GET /scans/{id}/results` accepts
  `include_accepted_risk` filter (mirrors `include_info`).
- **2025-07-10** — `findings`: drop empty Dalfox results at parse
  time (the old behaviour wrote a bare row with no payload).
- **2025-07-12** — **`csrf_validation` probe** + per-manifest
  `requires_post` gate (probes that need a POST opt in explicitly).
- **2025-07-13** — Server: resolve relative `evidence_url` against the
  scan target before invoking probes.
- **2025-07-15** — **Live risk score**: recompute from the current
  state of findings, exclude `false_positive`/`fixed`/`accepted_risk`
  from the rollup.
- **2025-07-17 / 07-19** — Extend live risk + triage exclusion to the
  `/` dashboard and the `/assessments` listing page.
- **2025-07-20 / 07-22 / 07-24** — Trend chart + listing improvements:
  filter typeahead, drop info-severity from the chart by default,
  Resolved-by-age card, dual-side Y-axis labels, hover tooltip,
  legend below the date row.
- **2025-07-26** — Orchestrator: register `scan_id` with the
  assessment row before spawning the scanner subprocess (so a crash
  mid-spawn doesn't lose the link).
- **2025-07-27** — UI: stop assessment-row click from accidentally
  toggling its bulk-action checkbox.
- **2025-07-29** — `findings`: drop nikto end-of-scan summary lines
  from the parsed output.
- **2025-07-31** — **Reproduce-&-verify panel** with request /
  response modals on the finding detail page.


## 2025-08 — Validate / Test surface, login_page_check

- **2025-08-02** — `findings`: extract path prefix from nikto lines
  into `evidence_url` (was previously the bare host).
- **2025-08-04** — **Inline Validate button** + modal for read-only
  probes on the workspace panel.
- **2025-08-05** — **Auto-validate at end of scan**: orchestrator
  runs every read-only toolkit probe against its matched findings and
  auto-flips high-confidence FPs.
- **2025-08-07 / 08-09** — **Test button**: one-click, scope-locked
  live request from the reproduce modal; surfaced on the standalone
  finding page too.
- **2025-08-11 / 08-12 / 08-14** — Modal polish: surface the specific
  weakness + scan evidence; TLS-aware Test for `testssl` findings;
  collapse "Edit Guidance"; cert-info Test for non-testssl SSL/TLS
  findings.
- **2025-08-16** — Better validation for the
  *"Administrative interface exposed"* family.
- **2025-08-18** — Better validation + faster Test (TLS handshake-only
  path) for cert-shape findings.
- **2025-08-19** — **`login_page_check` probe** + tighten
  `admin_exposure` routing so admin findings are claimed by the right
  probe class.
- **2025-08-21 / 08-23** — Test (nuclei) for nuclei findings; suppress
  Nikto pre-scan noise; fix the case where Test refused finding 925
  because of an "is HTTP" mis-classification.
- **2025-08-25** — Toolkit: stop tier-2/3 routing on top-level OWASP
  categories (catch-alls were claiming everything).
- **2025-08-27** — UI: "Send to agent" button matches sibling action
  buttons; search-refraction icon.
- **2025-08-28** — `findings`: capture full request/response on
  default-cred hits + 75-pair catalog (so the reproduce-&-verify modal
  has actual evidence to render).
- **2025-08-30** — **DB backup/restore** + real reproduce-&-verify per
  source tool.


## 2025-09 — SCA, auth hardening, branding pass

- **2025-09-01** — Rewire enhanced_testing probes for Validate /
  Challenge + thorough SQLi walkthrough.
- **2025-09-03** — UI: Challenge button shows the real
  `safety_class` from the manifest (was hard-coded "Read-only").
- **2025-09-04** — Surface Challenge button + probe chip in the
  workspace panel.
- **2025-09-06 / 09-10** — Reproduce-&-verify steps and Challenge
  button align flush left.
- **2025-09-08** — **`testssl_recheck` probe** — Validate button on
  every TLS finding.
- **2025-09-12** — Tighten probe routing + surface the real Challenge
  reason in the verdict UI.
- **2025-09-13** — **Auth hardening**: CSRF middleware on every
  state-changing endpoint, audit log, close the blank-password
  footgun on `/setup`.
- **2025-09-15 / 09-17** — Report: PDF link color is print-readable
  blue (not the brand primary which can be unreadable on print);
  expose `pdf_link_color` as an explicit theming control.
- **2025-09-18** — `enhanced_testing`: every probe in the TODO.md
  roadmap is now shipped.
- **2025-09-20** — **Rename pentest-proxy → nextgen-dast.** Drop the
  bootstrap-creds hint banner now that the seeded password is shown
  once via `pentest.sh reset` only.
- **2025-09-22** — Report: drop the inline color override on
  reference links so they pick up the print-readable theme variable.
- **2025-09-24** — **SCA stage**: software-composition analysis with
  retire.js + osv-scanner + LLM cache (vulnerable JS / npm libraries
  detected per scan, cached by content hash).
- **2025-09-26** — SCA: escape literal `%` in `LIKE` patterns for
  PyMySQL formatting.
- **2025-09-27** — SCA: broaden the JS-asset crawl, content
  fingerprint match, suppress noise rows that always reproduce.
- **2025-09-29** — Report: realistic overall grade — per-category cap,
  diminishing returns, coverage bonus, validation floor.


## 2025-10 — SCA validation, schedules, branding

- **2025-10-01** — Report: tiered exploitability gate + captured
  password masking in the PDF.
- **2025-10-03** — **`sca_finding_validate` probe**: targeted
  validation that fetches the cited JS file and compares the banner
  version to the CVE's vulnerable range. Useful PDF reproduction for
  SCA findings now embeds the diff.
- **2025-10-05** — `sca_js_libraries`: fix `Response` attribute names
  (`.status` / `.body`, not `.status_code` / `.content`).
- **2025-10-06** — **Challenge All button** + **False positives**
  filter option on the assessment-detail page. Adds a one-click bulk
  Challenge that runs every matched probe class (including the
  payload-injecting probes), and a pseudo-severity in the filter
  dropdown that lists every suppressed finding regardless of the
  Open/Closed/All tab.
- **2025-10-08** — **Cron-driven schedules**: per-assessment cron
  schedule + `keep_only_latest` auto-dedupe so a recurring scan
  doesn't pile up duplicate rows.
- **2025-10-10** — Docs: expand `pentest.sh` Day-2 reference with the
  full operations table.
- **2025-10-11 / 10-13 / 10-15 / 10-17** — **Branding pass**:
  optional classification footer, auto-heal schema for new branding
  columns, logo redirect fix; surface the web logo on sidebar +
  login; clamp uploaded-logo width; harden icon + sidebar-logo
  sizing against missing or blocked CSS.
- **2025-10-19** — Bulk-challenge runner re-runs `errored` /
  `inconclusive` rows (not just unvalidated); modal delete confirm
  replaces `window.confirm()`.
- **2025-10-20 / 10-22** — Sidebar: stack brand logo above company
  name, then center the pair.
- **2025-10-24 / 10-26** — Rename "Send to agent" → "Challenge";
  Font Awesome scale-balanced icon; inline Challenge button (no
  confirm popup, in-place status badge).
- **2025-10-28** — Assessment filter dropdown: "Resolved"
  pseudo-severity (separate from severities, filters by status).
- **2025-10-29** — Assessment filter dropdown: "Fixed" and
  "Archive (accepted risk)" join Resolved as pseudo-severities.


## 2026-05 — High-fidelity CSRF rule + anomaly_5xx_validation

- **2026-05-01** — **`anomaly_5xx_validation` probe v1.0** — new
  validator for wapiti / nuclei / nikto "anomaly: Internal Server
  Error" findings. Replays the captured HTTP request, scans the
  5xx response body for real information disclosure (stack traces,
  framework banners, internal paths, SQL errors), and uses a
  same-wire-length benign control payload to disambiguate
  content-driven 5xx (a real robustness bug) from upstream buffer
  / proxy header overflow (the common false-positive mode where a
  long parameter is reflected into a redirect Location header that
  exceeds nginx's proxy_buffer_size).
  - Module-aware sanity: `file`-module / LFI findings against a
    Python / Node / Java stack also note that `php://filter`
    chains are semantically impossible regardless of the 5xx
    behaviour.
  - Sizes the control payload by the parameter's WIRE length
    (url-encoded bytes), not its decoded length, since the
    upstream-buffer overflow is triggered by encoded bytes.
  - Routed via `matches_titles` for "anomaly: Internal Server
    Error", "anomaly: 502 Bad Gateway", etc. and via
    `matches_tools` (wapiti / nuclei / nikto) so multi-tool
    pipelines all hit it.

- **2026-05-01** — **`csrf_validation` probe v1.2** — full rewrite
  of the verdict logic so wapiti CSRF findings are no longer left
  `inconclusive` when the form has no synchronizer token.
  - Drop the "first hidden field is the token" fallback that
    mis-identified post-login redirect inputs (`next`, `redirect_to`)
    as CSRF tokens, then bailed when they were empty.
  - Add an Origin/Referer enforcement battery (cross-origin POST,
    no-Origin POST) that runs whether or not a synchronizer token is
    present — so apps that defend via Origin checking instead of a
    form token are correctly classified as defended.
  - Distinguish auth-failure responses (401, "invalid credentials"
    body) from CSRF-rejection responses (403/419, "forbidden",
    "cross-origin", "csrf token mismatch", etc.). The earlier code
    lumped them together and false-flagged auth-rejected baselines
    as CSRF-rejected.
  - Tighten the bypass classification: only "smoking-gun" tampering
    (no-token / garbage / cross-session swap / cross-origin POST)
    triggers `validated=True`. Informational gaps (no-Origin
    requests, cross-session cookie jar against an unauthenticated
    form) are recorded in evidence but no longer escalate the
    verdict, since they don't correspond to a realistic
    modern-browser attack.
  - Capture cookie SameSite attributes in evidence so analysts can
    see browser-side defense-in-depth at a glance.
  - Manifest budgets bumped to typical=9 / max=16 to cover the new
    Origin tests, plus a new `--attacker-origin` knob.

## Pending — not yet released

- Tier-3 advanced LLM consolidation pass (per-flow deep analysis hook
  is wired in `consolidation.run` but not yet enabled).
